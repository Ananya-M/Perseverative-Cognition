# Perseverative-Cognition
A pilot study

Defined as the 'repeated or chronic activation of the cognitive representation of psychological stressors' (Brosschot, Gerin, & Thayer, 2006), Perseverative cognition frequently results in individuals dwelling on stressful events in their minds for prolonged periods.These persistent thoughts, recurring over time, contribute to heightened stress and anxiety, with potential implications for serious health conditions like depression and personality disorders.In my research project, I delved into the EEG biomarkers associated with these periods of rumination, aiming to understand whether individuals practicing meditation exhibit enhanced stress management abilities.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

1.  A thorough literature survey of the existing questionnaires and models regarding perseverative cognition.
2.	About 20 questionnaires, mentioned in the introduction were assessed to identify a unique model to experimentally induce rumination in laboratory conditions.
3.	Each subject is asked to fill in the RRS-Q which comprises 22 questions, whose score is revealed at the end of the test.This is an online test by psy tool kit.
4.	Post the RRS-Q, the subject is asked to go into a state of rumination by self report method. This is a seven minute process. During the first two minutes, the EEG is recorded during the state of relaxation. During the next five minutes, EEG is recorded of the subject during the process of rumination using the Open BCI system. The data from 21 channels are processed by the openBCI software (Of the 21 channels, 2 are reference), whose sampling rate is 125 Hz.
5.	A database of 24 subjects is created of the  EEG recorded.
6.	The recorded EEG is processed using Matlab software. Each data of seven minutes is segmented into five and two minute segments.
7.	Fourier analysis was applied to both two minute and seven minute data of each subject. The Fourier analysis included band extraction and power spectral density of each segment.
8.	The maximum and mean PSD of each band waveforms is tabulated.
9.	The entropy of each band waveform is obtained and tabulated.
    
Rumination Response Scale

People think and do many different things when they feel depressed. Please read each of the items below and indicate whether you almost never, sometimes, often, or almost always think or do each one when you feel down, sad, or depressed. Please indicate what you generally do, not
what you think you should do.
This questionnaire is rated from 1- 4 options and summed over all the questions, with 88 being the maximum, 22 being minimum and 55 being the average. It is seen that women score 42 on an average and men score 39.6
1 almost never  2 sometimes  3 often   4 almost always

1. think about how alone you feel
2. think “I won’t be able to do my job if I don’t snap out of this”
3. think about your feelings of fatigue and achiness
4. think about how hard it is to concentrate
5. think “What am I doing to deserve this?”
6. think about how passive and unmotivated you feel.
7. analyze recent events to try to understand why you are depressed
8. think about how you don’t seem to feel anything anymore
9. think “Why can’t I get going?”
10. think “Why do I always react this way?”
11. go away by yourself and think about why you feel this way
12. write down what you are thinking about and analyze it
13. think about a recent situation, wishing it had gone better
14. think “I won’t be able to concentrate if I keep feeling this way.”
15. think “Why do I have problems other people don’t have?”
16. think “Why can’t I handle things better?”
17. think about how sad you feel.
18. think about all your shortcomings, failings, faults, mistakes
19. think about how you don’t feel up to doing anything
20. analyze your personality to try to understand why you are depressed
21.go someplace alone to think about your feelings
22. think about how angry you are with yourself

Rumination assessment questionnaire

This questionnaire comprises of  5 questions which scores the extent of rumination during the process. Each question has 7 terms ranging from positive options to negative options, out of which one is chosen. This questionnaire is particularly helpful to choose the effective data i.e. data of subjects who deeply ruminated.


Rumination Assessment Questionnaire
Directions : Please consider your thoughts and feelings about this session and use the scale to answer the following questions.
This questionnaire is rated from 1- 7 options and summed over all the questions, with 35 being the maximum, 5 being minimum and 30 being the average. 
The options can be scored from 1 to 7, with 1 being not at all and 7 being very much

1.	In regard to this session, were your thoughts positive, negative or neutral?
2.	To what extent were you able to indulge in your repetitive thoughts in this session?
3.	How stressed were you during the thought process?
4. How depressed did you feel during the thought process?
5. How often do these thoughts occur to you?
